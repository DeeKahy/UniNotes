# UniNotes

Welcome to UniNotes, a resource for university students to access and learn from notes and materials.

UniNotes is brought to you by DeeKahy and Mantarias, two dedicated students who understand the importance of having a reliable and comprehensive resource for studying. Our goal is to provide students with a collection of notes and materials that cover a wide range of courses and subjects, as well as to offer a platform for students to share and contribute their own notes.

On UniNotes, you will find a collection of notes, summaries, and study guides, organized by subject and course. We have also included a search feature to help you find specific information or resources quickly and easily.

We hope that you find UniNotes to be a valuable resource and we welcome your feedback and suggestions. If you have any questions or need help with your studies, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for visiting UniNotes. We look forward to helping you succeed in your studies.
