!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 1"

    What is the main purpose of the envisionment phase in a software development project?

presenting the design and evaluation of ideas

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 2"

    Why is it important to go through the envisioment phase?

It provides some sort of structure for the development phase. And the design can be evaluated if it meets the requirements

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 3"

    How does envisionment support requirements elicitation?

by using wireframes you can display your envision for product and get your stakeholders' opinion of those and if they meet the requirements

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 4"

    Name at least five envisionment techniques, explain the different techniques, and when they are most likely to be used in the design process.

sketching early before the design is in place

storyboards middle

wireframes middle

navigational maps: end

Prototypes?: end

!!! Question  "Envisionment – Exercise 5"

    In which part of the design and development process would you use a tool like Balsamiq and why?

middle to make wireframes of how stuff should look like

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 6"

    What elements of a design do you focus on in lo-fi prototyping? (low fidelity)

Where the buttons might be located
Where the navigation might be located
General layout

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 7"

    How would you explain the difference between lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping? (low fidelity & high fidelity)

Lo-fi focuses on the genreal layout
Hi-fi is a done looking prototype with some functionality

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 8"

    What could be some disadvantages of developing hi-fi prototypes too early in the envisionment phase?

Expensive, time consuming, high commitment, and hard to make radical changes.

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 9"

    What is the fundamental difference between a sketch and a prototype?

The prototype has some functionality, a sketch has none.

!!! Question "Envisionment – Exercise 10"

    What are the benefits of user sketching?

Getting valuable information on where the users think buttons and functionality should be located
