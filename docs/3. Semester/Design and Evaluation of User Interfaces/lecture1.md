!!! Question
    Why did the use of the system lead to a poor/good experience?

Poor experience: dashboard is cluttered and displays way too much irrelevant information. Books/cards are not laid out nicely and some of them have nonsensical names. Clicking into a book is inconsistent and brings up irrelevant or empty pages the search is slow and unresponsive and could use improvement


Good experience: easy accessibility for light and dark mode. No bombardment of information upon visit. Amazing search. Nice theme

!!! Question
    How would you improve this?

Poor experience: cleaning up the main interface. Make pages act consistently. Better contrast between background color and text color

!!! Question
    How could you improve this further?

Folders acting as notes. Better navigation bar. Adjusting heading color, so it doesn't blend in as much in dark mode. Adjusting highlighting color in light mode.
