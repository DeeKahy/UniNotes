# What is it?

It is basically a way of working with and designing bigger systems/applications.

The way this class works by trying to design systems in various ways.

!!! Abstract

    the point with this class is to use oop programming effectively by understanding classes and using object for different aspects of your application

|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Analysis       | Understanding a system in its context and conditions for implementation.                       |
| Design         | Create a theoretical system without many unknown/uncertainties as possible.                    |
| Implementation | Realize a design on a technical platform = programming/setting up the physical objects.         |
| Method         | The method can be multiple things, water fall and iterative ??? Needs more text.               |
| Granularity    | How accurate does the system need to be.                                                       |



!!! Example

    Lets say we have 2 systems. System 1 needs to keep track of items and system 2 just needs to work with piles of dirt. In system one it is very important every object has its own unique id, but in system two we dont need an id for each rock, if the piles have an id that would be good enough. This is because individual rocks wont ever need a unique id so why spare the resources for one, whilst the items do need their own because they will get shipped out to different adresses.


Problem Domain = the problem we want solved

Application Domain = the tools we can use to solve the problem




# Examples

    Problem Domain

        the greenhouse and its temperature

    Application Domain = mantinance?

        gardener
