# Lecture 04

the divide and conquer is used for reoccurences else known as recursive functions

3 different methods
!!! Substitution

    gues the form of the solution first then use mathematical induction to prove the solution
    can be used to find constants


!!! recursion-tree

## Exercise 1

Consider the following recurrence T(n) = T(2n/3) + Î˜(1). Prove that T(n) = O(lg n).

O(n^log~b~a-^)

a = 1 

b = 3/2
