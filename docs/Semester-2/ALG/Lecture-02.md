## Exercise 1.
CLRS-3 3.1–1 Let f(n) and g(n) be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of Θ-notation, prove that max(f(n), g(n)) = Θ(f(n) + g(n)). Remark: A function f(n) is asymptotically nonnegative if there exists n0 such that f(n) 0 for all n ≥ n0

CLRS-3 3.1–4 Is 2n+1 = Θ(2n)? Is 22n = O(2n)?
