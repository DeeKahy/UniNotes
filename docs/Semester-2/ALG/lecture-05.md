## exercise 1

Exercise 1.
Consider the Max-Heapify procedure as defined below.

### base case
A = [1]

it checks but fails at all if statements because l and r are both out of range and largest is equals i which lets the recursive function exit.

### inductive step:
A = [1, 2] // remember it sorts backwards


here the left check completes and sets largest = l which then inturn allows the largest != i to run which swaps the location of i and largest, then the function runs again and it completes without any cases being true which then breaks us out of the recursion.

### the last step
A = [1, 3, 2, n4.......nx] // remember it sorts backwards
