Divide & conquer

divide problem into a number of disjoint subproblems that are smaller instances of same problem

Conquer the subproblem by solving them recursively. If the subproblem is small (and easy) enough solve it trivially 

Combine the solution of the subproblems into the solution for the original problem

else it can be trivial to solve
