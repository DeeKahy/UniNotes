# Markdown Example Document

## Introduction

This document showcases various Markdown elements, including math expressions and code blocks.

## Math Expressions

You can use LaTeX syntax to write math expressions inline or in block format:

Inline math: $E=mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\int_{0}^{1} x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

## Code Blocks

You can format code using code blocks. Here's an example of Python code:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

And here's an example of JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists:

Unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Formatting

You can **bold** text, _italicize_ text, and ~~strike through~~ text.

## Links and Images

You can add links to websites: [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/)

| Name     | Age | Occupation |
|----------|-----|------------|
| Alice    | 28  | Engineer   |
| Bob      | 35  | Designer   |
| Charlie  | 22  | Student    |
